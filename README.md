## Introduction

HelpingHand is a project that aims at improving web accessibility for individuals with different sort of disabilities. In an era where the digital world dominates our lives, we recognize the critical need for inclusive web services. This project endeavors to bridge the accessibility gap and make online content available to everyone, regardless of their abilities.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech with Summarization**: Our web app seamlessly converts the whole text content on the webpage into a brief summary in realtime and with the help of Text-to-Speech we can help the blind people know about the content on the webpage

- **Color Contrast Customization**: Users with color blindness can adjust contrast settings to ensure content is easily distinguishable.

- **Live Captioning**: Real-time captioning of audio and video content for users with hearing impairments.

- **Text To Speech and Speech To Text**: A groundbreaking feature that enables users with mobility challenges to navigate the web using facial gestures.

![flowchart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nj3RTugjbGuysRBWTSb0g4M7Hlyddgii/view?usp=sharing)

As given in the flowchart when the user will first land on our website he will see a very elegant and a very calm front-end.

![ss_1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17stY5aHI5VaIqg9gPfLHyrzywi9Mj_8P/view?usp=sharing)

then the user will have to select options we currently have for some of the most common disabilities 

![ss2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17stY5aHI5VaIqg9gPfLHyrzywi9Mj_8P/view?usp=sharing)

by selecting the option the user can now without any issue access the services provided on the web.


## Adaptive Features

### Text-to-Speech with Summarization;
Our Text-to-Speech with Summarization will serve a big role on letting the people with disablities to access all the services provided by the web without any hassle.Some might this integration very helpful as we did find that just for an example if someone is browsing over Amazon or Flipkart they will not read every content written on the webpage but only the stuff they actually care about like the price, reviews, comparisons etc.
so keeping that in mind for people who are blind if they go over any platform which has major part content as text this tool will tell them about the crisp version of content on webpage.



### Color Contrast Customization

Users with have an option of switching to a higher contrast webpage. In just one click the user can have the page with high contrast in his hands. This tool will help the users with color blindness.

### Live Captioning

Real-time captioning of audio and video content for users with hearing impairments is automatically activated. No additional steps are required.
